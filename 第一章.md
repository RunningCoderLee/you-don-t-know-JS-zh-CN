# 你不知道的JS: Up & Going
# 第一章：进入编程

欢迎来到*你不知道的JS系列* (*YDKJS*).

*Up & Going*会介绍关于编程的几个基本概念--当然我们更倾向于JavaScript(简称为JS)--还有如何去理解这系列其余的标题。尤其如果您刚接触到编程或是JavaScript，这本书将简要探讨您将从*up and going*学到什么。

这本书将用比较高的水平解释基本的编程原理。如果您在看*YDKJS*之前没有任何的编程经验，希望这些书可以帮助您以JavaScript为镜头开始沿着一条路径理解编程。

第1章快速概括关于进入编程您想要了解和实践的东西。当然也有许多其他出色的编程介绍资源，可以帮助您进一步挖掘这些主题，我鼓励您除了本章也学习他们。

一旦你能适应编程基础，第二章将帮助指导你熟悉JavaScript编程。第2章介绍了什么是JavaScript，但再一次说明，这本书不是一本全面的指南——这就是剩下的* YDKJS *书!

如果你已经相当熟悉JavaScript，首先查看第3章，简要地看一下期望从* YDKJS *得到什么，然后开始学习！

## 代码

让我们从头开始。

计算机程序，通常被称为*源代码*或只是*代码*，是一组特殊的指令，告诉计算机要执行什么任务。 通常代码保存在文本文件中，尽管使用JavaScript，您也可以直接在浏览器的开发者控制台中输入代码，我们稍后将介绍。

有效格式和指令组合的规则被称为*计算机语言*，有时称为*语法*，与英语告诉你如何拼写单词和如何使用单词和标点创建有效的句子一样。

### 语句

在计算机语言中，执行特定任务的一组字符，数字和运算符是*语句*。 在JavaScript中，语句可能如下所示：

```js
a = b * 2;
```

字符`a`和`b`称为*变量*（参见“变量”），它们就像简单的容器，你可以存储任何东西。在程序中，变量保存的值（如数字42）被程序使用。把他们作为自己的值象征性的占位符。

相比之下，`2`只是一个值本身，称为*字面值*，因为它独立存在于变量中。

`=`和`*`字符是*运算符*（参见“运算符”） -- 它们使用值和变量（如赋值和数学乘法）执行操作。

JavaScript中的大多数语句最后都以分号（`;`）结束。

语句`a = b * 2;`告诉计算机，获取存储在变量`b`中的当前值，将该值乘以`2`，然后将结果存入另一个变量`a`中 。

程序只是许多这样的语句的集合，它们一起描述了执行程序目的所需的所有步骤。

### Expressions （张静）

Statements are made up of one or more *expressions*. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.

For example:

```js
a = b * 2;
```

This statement has four expressions in it:

* `2` is a *literal value expression*
* `b` is a *variable expression*, which means to retrieve its current value
* `b * 2` is an *arithmetic expression*, which means to do the multiplication
* `a = b * 2` is an *assignment expression*, which means to assign the result of the `b * 2` expression to the variable `a` (more on assignments later)

A general expression that stands alone is also called an *expression statement*, such as the following:

```js
b * 2;
```

This flavor of expression statement is not very common or useful, as generally it wouldn't have any effect on the running of the program -- it would retrieve the value of `b` and multiply it by `2`, but then wouldn't do anything with that result.

A more common expression statement is a *call expression* statement (see "Functions"), as the entire statement is the function call expression itself:

```js
alert( a );
```

### Executing a Program （张静）

How do those collections of programming statements tell the computer what to do? The program needs to be *executed*, also referred to as *running the program*.

Statements like `a = b * 2` are helpful for developers when reading and writing, but are not actually in a form the computer can directly understand. So a special utility on the computer (either an *interpreter* or a *compiler*) is used to translate the code you write into commands a computer can understand.

For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program is run, which is usually called *interpreting* the code.

For other languages, the translation is done ahead of time, called *compiling* the code, so when the program *runs* later, what's running is actually the already compiled computer instructions ready to go.

It's typically asserted that JavaScript is *interpreted*, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run. But that's not entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually *compiles* the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.

**Note:** For more information on JavaScript compiling, see the first two chapters of the *Scope & Closures* title of this series.

## Try It Yourself （张静）

This chapter is going to introduce each programming concept with simple snippets of code, all written in JavaScript (obviously!).

It cannot be emphasized enough: while you go through this chapter -- and you may need to spend the time to go over it several times -- you should practice each of these concepts by typing the code yourself. The easiest way to do that is to open up the developer tools console in your nearest browser (Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc.).

**Tip:** Typically, you can launch the developer console with a keyboard shortcut or from a menu item. For more detailed information about launching and using the console in your favorite browser, see "Mastering The Developer Tools Console" (http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/mastering-developer-tools-console). To type multiple lines into the console at once, use `<shift> + <enter>` to move to the next new line. Once you hit `<enter>` by itself, the console will run everything you've just typed.

Let's get familiar with the process of running code in the console. First, I suggest opening up an empty tab in your browser. I prefer to do this by typing `about:blank` into the address bar. Then, make sure your developer console is open, as we just mentioned.

Now, type this code and see how it runs:

```js
a = 21;

b = a * 2;

console.log( b );
```

Typing the preceding code into the console in Chrome should produce something like the following:

<img src="fig1.png" width="500">

Go on, try it. The best way to learn programming is to start coding!

### Output （翠翠）

In the previous code snippet, we used `console.log(..)`. Briefly, let's look at what that line of code is all about.

You may have guessed, but that's exactly how we print text (aka *output* to the user) in the developer console. There are two characteristics of that statement that we should explain.

First, the `log( b )` part is referred to as a function call (see "Functions"). What's happening is we're handing the `b` variable to that function, which asks it to take the value of `b` and print it to the console.

Second, the `console.` part is an object reference where the `log(..)` function is located. We cover objects and their properties in more detail in Chapter 2.

Another way of creating output that you can see is to run an `alert(..)` statement. For example:

```js
alert( b );
```

If you run that, you'll notice that instead of printing the output to the console, it shows a popup "OK" box with the contents of the `b` variable. However, using `console.log(..)` is generally going to make learning about coding and running your programs in the console easier than using `alert(..)`, because you can output many values at once without interrupting the browser interface.

For this book, we'll use `console.log(..)` for output.

###输出
在早期的代码片段中,我们使用`console.log(..)`作为输出。好的,让我们看看这行代码到底是干什么的。
也许你已经猜到了,正是我们在开发人员的控制台上打印文本(对于用户又叫做*output*)。有两个关于声明的特征我们要做解释。
第一点,`log(b)`这一部分被称为函数的调用(参考"Functions").当我们把变量`b`传给函数时,函数拿到变量b的值并将它打印在控制台
第二点,`console.`这部分是一个对象的引用,在`log(..)`函数被创建的地方。我们将会在第二章详细介绍对象以及它的属性。
你可以运行一个`alert(..)`的声明,这是另一种创建输出的方式。例如:
```js
alert( b );
```
如果你运行它,你会注意到它显示了一个内容包含了变量`b`和带有"OK"框的弹出框,而不是在控制台打印输出。但是,使用`console.log(..)`比使用`alert(..)`通常会让学习编码并运行你的程序在控制台更容易的多,因为你一次可以输入多个值却不会妨碍浏览器界面。
在这本书里,我们将会使用`console.log(..)`作为输出。

### Input （翠翠）

While we're discussing output, you may also wonder about *input* (i.e., receiving information from the user).

The most common way that happens is for the HTML page to show form elements (like text boxes) to a user that they can type into, and then using JS to read those values into your program's variables.

But there's an easier way to get input for simple learning and demonstration purposes such as what you'll be doing throughout this book. Use the `prompt(..)` function:

```js
age = prompt( "Please tell me your age:" );

console.log( age );
```

As you may have guessed, the message you pass to `prompt(..)` -- in this case, `"Please tell me your age:"` -- is printed into the popup.

This should look similar to the following:

<img src="fig2.png" width="500">

Once you submit the input text by clicking "OK," you'll observe that the value you typed is stored in the `age` variable, which we then *output* with `console.log(..)`:

<img src="fig3.png" width="500">

To keep things simple while we're learning basic programming concepts, the examples in this book will not require input. But now that you've seen how to use `prompt(..)`, if you want to challenge yourself you can try to use input in your explorations of the examples.

###输入
当我们讨论输出时,你可能还想知道输入(即,接受用户的信息)。
最常见的方式就是发生在HTML页面显示表单元素(像文本输入框),用户可以输入,然后使用JS将这些值读取到程序的变量里。
但是有一个更容易的方法去得到输入,简单的学习和描述的目的,例如你将会在这本书里做些什么。使用`prompt(..)`这个函数:
```js
age = prompt( "Please tell me your age:" );

console.log( age );
```
正如你所猜想的,在这种情况下,信息通过`prompt(..)`这个方法,`"Please tell me your age:"`被打印在弹出框里。
如图所示:
<img src="fig2.png" width="500">
一旦你点击"OK"提交输入值,你会注意到你输入的值被存储在`age`变量中,同`console.log(..)`输出:
<img src="fig3.png" width="500">
为了简单,当我们正在学习基本的编程概念,这本书的例子没有要求输入。但是现在你已经了解了如何使用`prompt(..)`这个方法,如果你想挑战你自己,你可以试着在你探索的例子中使用输入。

## Operators （翠翠）

Operators are how we perform actions on variables and values. We've already seen two JavaScript operators, the `=` and the `*`.

The `*` operator performs mathematic multiplication. Simple enough, right?

The `=` equals operator is used for *assignment* -- we first calculate the value on the *right-hand side* (source value) of the `=` and then put it into the variable that we specify on the *left-hand side* (target variable).

**Warning:** This may seem like a strange reverse order to specify assignment. Instead of `a = 42`, some might prefer to flip the order so the source value is on the left and the target variable is on the right, like `42 -> a` (this is not valid JavaScript!). Unfortunately, the `a = 42` ordered form, and similar variations, is quite prevalent in modern programming languages. If it feels unnatural, just spend some time rehearsing that ordering in your mind to get accustomed to it.

Consider:

```js
a = 2;
b = a + 1;
```

Here, we assign the `2` value to the `a` variable. Then, we get the value of the `a` variable (still `2`), add `1` to it resulting in the value `3`, then store that value in the `b` variable.

While not technically an operator, you'll need the keyword `var` in every program, as it's the primary way you *declare* (aka *create*) *var*iables (see "Variables").

You should always declare the variable by name before you use it. But you only need to declare a variable once for each *scope* (see "Scope"); it can be used as many times after that as needed. For example:

```js
var a = 20;

a = a + 1;
a = a * 2;

console.log( a );	// 42
```

Here are some of the most common operators in JavaScript:

* Assignment: `=` as in `a = 2`.
* Math: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), and `/` (division), as in `a * 3`.
* Compound Assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` are compound operators that combine a math operation with assignment, as in `a += 2` (same as `a = a + 2`).
* Increment/Decrement: `++` (increment), `--` (decrement), as in `a++` (similar to `a = a + 1`).
* Object Property Access: `.` as in `console.log()`.

   Objects are values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties. `obj.a` means an object value called `obj` with a property of the name `a`. Properties can alternatively be accessed as `obj["a"]`. See Chapter 2.
* Equality: `==` (loose-equals), `===` (strict-equals), `!=` (loose not-equals), `!==` (strict not-equals), as in `a == b`.

   See "Values & Types" and Chapter 2.
* Comparison: `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or loose-equals), `>=` (greater than or loose-equals), as in `a <= b`.

   See "Values & Types" and Chapter 2.
* Logical: `&&` (and), `||` (or), as in `a || b` that selects either `a` *or* `b`.

   These operators are used to express compound conditionals (see "Conditionals"), like if either `a` *or* `b` is true.

**Note:** For much more detail, and coverage of operators not mentioned here, see the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)'s "Expressions and Operators" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators).
##操作符
操作符是如何执行操作变量和值的，我们已经看到两个JavaScript操作符，`=`和`*`。
`*`操作符执行数学乘法，足够的简单，对吧？
`=`等于操作符用于赋值，我们首先计算`=`右边的值（原始值），然后把它放到我们指定`=`左边变量（目标变量）中。
**Warning:** 看起来好像一个奇怪的反向指定赋值。而不是`a = 42`,有些可能倾向于左边是原始值，右边是目标变量，像`42 -> a`（这在JavaScript是不被允许的！）。
不幸的是，以`a = 42`的命名形式，还有类似的，在现代编程语言中是相当普遍的。如果感觉不自然，那就花些时间练习到你习惯为止。
思考：
```js
a = 2;
b = a + 1;
```
这里，我们给变量`a`赋值`2`。接着，我们得到变量`a`的值（仍然是`2`），加上`1`结果是`3`，变量`b`存储的就是`3`。
从技术上讲，在每个程序中你都需要一个关键字`var`，这是主要的声明（也叫创建）方式。
在你使用变量前你需要先声明一个变量。一旦你声明了一个变量，你就可以使用许它多次了。例如：
```js
var a = 20;

a = a + 1;
a = a * 2;

console.log( a );	// 42
```
以下是在JavaScript中常见的一些操作符：
* 赋值操作符：`=`如`a = 2`。
* 算术操作符：`+` (加), `-` (减), `*` (乘), and `/` (除), 如 `a * 3`.
* 复合赋值操作符：`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, 和 `/=` 是结合了算术操作符和赋值操作符的复合赋值操作符，像`a += 2` (即`a = a + 2`)。
* 递增/递减操作符：`++`(递增操作符)，`--`（递减操作符），如`a++`（即`a = a + 1`）。
* 对象操作符：`.`如`console.log()`。
  对象值是其他值在特定命名的位置称为属性，`obj.a`就是一个叫对象`obj`带有一个叫`a`属性的值。属性也可以这样访问其值`obj[a]`，见第二章。
* 相等操作符： `==`（想等），`===`（全等），`!=`（不相等），`!==`（不全等），如`a == b`。
* 关系操作符：`<`（小于）`>`（大于）`<=`（小于或等于）`>=`（大于或等于），如`a <= b`。
* 逻辑操作符：`&&`（逻辑与），`||`（逻辑或），如`a || b`表示选择`a`或者`b`。
  这些操作符是用来表达复合条件(见Conditionals")，如果`a`或者`b`都为真。
**Note:** 更多的细节和操作符这里没有讲到，可以到Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)网站搜索"Expressions and Operators" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators).

## Values & Types （张雪）

If you ask an employee at a phone store how much a certain phone costs, and they say "ninety-nine, ninety-nine" (i.e., $99.99), they're giving you an actual numeric dollar figure that represents what you'll need to pay (plus taxes) to buy it. If you want to buy two of those phones, you can easily do the mental math to double that value to get $199.98 for your base cost.

If that same employee picks up another similar phone but says it's "free" (perhaps with air quotes), they're not giving you a number, but instead another kind of representation of your expected cost ($0.00) -- the word "free."

When you later ask if the phone includes a charger, that answer could only have been either "yes" or "no."

In very similar ways, when you express values in a program, you choose different representations for those values based on what you plan to do with them.

These different representations for values are called *types* in programming terminology. JavaScript has built-in types for each of these so called *primitive* values:

* When you need to do math, you want a `number`.
* When you need to print a value on the screen, you need a `string` (one or more characters, words, sentences).
* When you need to make a decision in your program, you need a `boolean` (`true` or `false`).

Values that are included directly in the source code are called *literals*. `string` literals are surrounded by double quotes `"..."` or single quotes (`'...'`) -- the only difference is stylistic preference. `number` and `boolean` literals are just presented as is (i.e., `42`, `true`, etc.).

Consider:

```js
"I am a string";
'I am also a string';

42;

true;
false;
```

Beyond `string`/`number`/`boolean` value types, it's common for programming languages to provide *arrays*, *objects*, *functions*, and more. We'll cover much more about values and types throughout this chapter and the next.

### Converting Between Types （张雪）

If you have a `number` but need to print it on the screen, you need to convert the value to a `string`, and in JavaScript this conversion is called "coercion." Similarly, if someone enters a series of numeric characters into a form on an ecommerce page, that's a `string`, but if you need to then use that value to do math operations, you need to *coerce* it to a `number`.

JavaScript provides several different facilities for forcibly coercing between *types*. For example:

```js
var a = "42";
var b = Number( a );

console.log( a );	// "42"
console.log( b );	// 42
```

Using `Number(..)` (a built-in function) as shown is an *explicit* coercion from any other type to the `number` type. That should be pretty straightforward.

But a controversial topic is what happens when you try to compare two values that are not already of the same type, which would require *implicit* coercion.

When comparing the string `"99.99"` to the number `99.99`, most people would agree they are equivalent. But they're not exactly the same, are they? It's the same value in two different representations, two different *types*. You could say they're "loosely equal," couldn't you?

To help you out in these common situations, JavaScript will sometimes kick in and *implicitly* coerce values to the matching types.

So if you use the `==` loose equals operator to make the comparison `"99.99" == 99.99`, JavaScript will convert the left-hand side `"99.99"` to its `number` equivalent `99.99`. The comparison then becomes `99.99 == 99.99`, which is of course `true`.

While designed to help you, implicit coercion can create confusion if you haven't taken the time to learn the rules that govern its behavior. Most JS developers never have, so the common feeling is that implicit coercion is confusing and harms programs with unexpected bugs, and should thus be avoided. It's even sometimes called a flaw in the design of the language.

However, implicit coercion is a mechanism that *can be learned*, and moreover *should be learned* by anyone wishing to take JavaScript programming seriously. Not only is it not confusing once you learn the rules, it can actually make your programs better! The effort is well worth it.

**Note:** For more information on coercion, see Chapter 2 of this title and Chapter 4 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.

## Code Comments （张雪）

The phone store employee might jot down some notes on the features of a newly released phone or on the new plans her company offers. These notes are only for the employee -- they're not for customers to read. Nevertheless, these notes help the employee do her job better by documenting the hows and whys of what she should tell customers.

One of the most important lessons you can learn about writing code is that it's not just for the computer. Code is every bit as much, if not more, for the developer as it is for the compiler.

Your computer only cares about machine code, a series of binary 0s and 1s, that comes from *compilation*. There's a nearly infinite number of programs you could write that yield the same series of 0s and 1s. The choices you make about how to write your program matter -- not only to you, but to your other team members and even to your future self.

You should strive not just to write programs that work correctly, but programs that make sense when examined. You can go a long way in that effort by choosing good names for your variables (see "Variables") and functions (see "Functions").

But another important part is code comments. These are bits of text in your program that are inserted purely to explain things to a human. The interpreter/compiler will always ignore these comments.

There are lots of opinions on what makes well-commented code; we can't really define absolute universal rules. But some observations and guidelines are quite useful:

* Code without comments is suboptimal.
* Too many comments (one per line, for example) is probably a sign of poorly written code.
* Comments should explain *why*, not *what*. They can optionally explain *how* if that's particularly confusing.

In JavaScript, there are two types of comments possible: a single-line comment and a multiline comment.

Consider:

```js
// This is a single-line comment

/* But this is
       a multiline
             comment.
                      */
```

The `//` single-line comment is appropriate if you're going to put a comment right above a single statement, or even at the end of a line. Everything on the line after the `//` is treated as the comment (and thus ignored by the compiler), all the way to the end of the line. There's no restriction to what can appear inside a single-line comment.

Consider:

```js
var a = 42;		// 42 is the meaning of life
```

The `/* .. */` multiline comment is appropriate if you have several lines worth of explanation to make in your comment.

Here's a common usage of multiline comments:

```js
/* The following value is used because
   it has been shown that it answers
   every question in the universe. */
var a = 42;
```

It can also appear anywhere on a line, even in the middle of a line, because the `*/` ends it. For example:

```js
var a = /* arbitrary value */ 42;

console.log( a );	// 42
```

The only thing that cannot appear inside a multiline comment is a `*/`, because that would be interpreted to end the comment.

You will definitely want to begin your learning of programming by starting off with the habit of commenting code. Throughout the rest of this chapter, you'll see I use comments to explain things, so do the same in your own practice. Trust me, everyone who reads your code will thank you!

## Variables （张润）

Most useful programs need to track a value as it changes over the course of the program, undergoing different operations as called for by your program's intended tasks.

The easiest way to go about that in your program is to assign a value to a symbolic container, called a *variable* -- so called because the value in this container can *vary* over time as needed.

In some programming languages, you declare a variable (container) to hold a specific type of value, such as `number` or `string`. *Static typing*, otherwise known as *type enforcement*, is typically cited as a benefit for program correctness by preventing unintended value conversions.

Other languages emphasize types for values instead of variables. *Weak typing*, otherwise known as *dynamic typing*, allows a variable to hold any type of value at any time. It's typically cited as a benefit for program flexibility by allowing a single variable to represent a value no matter what type form that value may take at any given moment in the program's logic flow.

JavaScript uses the latter approach, *dynamic typing*, meaning variables can hold values of any *type* without any *type* enforcement.

As mentioned earlier, we declare a variable using the `var` statement -- notice there's no other *type* information in the declaration. Consider this simple program:

```js
var amount = 99.99;

amount = amount * 2;

console.log( amount );		// 199.98

// convert `amount` to a string, and
// add "$" on the beginning
amount = "$" + String( amount );

console.log( amount );		// "$199.98"
```

The `amount` variable starts out holding the number `99.99`, and then holds the `number` result of `amount * 2`, which is `199.98`.

The first `console.log(..)` command has to *implicitly* coerce that `number` value to a `string` to print it out.

Then the statement `amount = "$" + String(amount)` *explicitly* coerces the `199.98` value to a `string` and adds a `"$"` character to the beginning. At this point, `amount` now holds the `string` value `"$199.98"`, so the second `console.log(..)` statement doesn't need to do any coercion to print it out.

JavaScript developers will note the flexibility of using the `amount` variable for each of the `99.99`, `199.98`, and the `"$199.98"` values. Static-typing enthusiasts would prefer a separate variable like `amountStr` to hold the final `"$199.98"` representation of the value, because it's a different type.

Either way, you'll note that `amount` holds a running value that changes over the course of the program, illustrating the primary purpose of variables: managing program *state*.

In other words, *state* is tracking the changes to values as your program runs.

Another common usage of variables is for centralizing value setting. This is more typically called *constants*, when you declare a variable with a value and intend for that value to *not change* throughout the program.

You declare these *constants*, often at the top of a program, so that it's convenient for you to have one place to go to alter a value if you need to. By convention, JavaScript variables as constants are usually capitalized, with underscores `_` between multiple words.

Here's a silly example:

```js
var TAX_RATE = 0.08;	// 8% sales tax

var amount = 99.99;

amount = amount * 2;

amount = amount + (amount * TAX_RATE);

console.log( amount );				// 215.9784
console.log( amount.toFixed( 2 ) );	// "215.98"
```

**Note:** Similar to how `console.log(..)` is a function `log(..)` accessed as an object property on the `console` value, `toFixed(..)` here is a function that can be accessed on `number` values. JavaScript `number`s aren't automatically formatted for dollars -- the engine doesn't know what your intent is and there's no type for currency. `toFixed(..)` lets us specify how many decimal places we'd like the `number` rounded to, and it produces the `string` as necessary.

The `TAX_RATE` variable is only *constant* by convention -- there's nothing special in this program that prevents it from being changed. But if the city raises the sales tax rate to 9%, we can still easily update our program by setting the `TAX_RATE` assigned value to `0.09` in one place, instead of finding many occurrences of the value `0.08` strewn throughout the program and updating all of them.

The newest version of JavaScript at the time of this writing (commonly called "ES6") includes a new way to declare *constants*, by using `const` instead of `var`:

```js
// as of ES6:
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;

var amount = 99.99;

// ..
```

Constants are useful just like variables with unchanged values, except that constants also prevent accidentally changing value somewhere else after the initial setting. If you tried to assign any different value to `TAX_RATE` after that first declaration, your program would reject the change (and in strict mode, fail with an error -- see "Strict Mode" in Chapter 2).

By the way, that kind of "protection" against mistakes is similar to the static-typing type enforcement, so you can see why static types in other languages can be attractive!

**Note:** For more information about how different values in variables can be used in your programs, see the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.

## Blocks （张润）

The phone store employee must go through a series of steps to complete the checkout as you buy your new phone.

Similarly, in code we often need to group a series of statements together, which we often call a *block*. In JavaScript, a block is defined by wrapping one or more statements inside a curly-brace pair `{ .. }`. Consider:

```js
var amount = 99.99;

// a general block
{
	amount = amount * 2;
	console.log( amount );	// 199.98
}
```

This kind of standalone `{ .. }` general block is valid, but isn't as commonly seen in JS programs. Typically, blocks are attached to some other control statement, such as an `if` statement (see "Conditionals") or a loop (see "Loops"). For example:

```js
var amount = 99.99;

// is amount big enough?
if (amount > 10) {			// <-- block attached to `if`
	amount = amount * 2;
	console.log( amount );	// 199.98
}
```

We'll explain `if` statements in the next section, but as you can see, the `{ .. }` block with its two statements is attached to `if (amount > 10)`; the statements inside the block will only be processed if the conditional passes.

**Note:** Unlike most other statements like `console.log(amount);`, a block statement does not need a semicolon (`;`) to conclude it.

## Conditionals （张润）

"Do you want to add on the extra screen protectors to your purchase, for $9.99?" The helpful phone store employee has asked you to make a decision. And you may need to first consult the current *state* of your wallet or bank account to answer that question. But obviously, this is just a simple "yes or no" question.

There are quite a few ways we can express *conditionals* (aka decisions) in our programs.

The most common one is the `if` statement. Essentially, you're saying, "*If* this condition is true, do the following...". For example:

```js
var bank_balance = 302.13;
var amount = 99.99;

if (amount < bank_balance) {
	console.log( "I want to buy this phone!" );
}
```

The `if` statement requires an expression in between the parentheses `( )` that can be treated as either `true` or `false`. In this program, we provided the expression `amount < bank_balance`, which indeed will either evaluate to `true` or `false` depending on the amount in the `bank_balance` variable.

You can even provide an alternative if the condition isn't true, called an `else` clause. Consider:

```js
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 302.13;
var amount = 99.99;

amount = amount * 2;

// can we afford the extra purchase?
if ( amount < bank_balance ) {
	console.log( "I'll take the accessory!" );
	amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
}
// otherwise:
else {
	console.log( "No, thanks." );
}
```

Here, if `amount < bank_balance` is `true`, we'll print out `"I'll take the accessory!"` and add the `9.99` to our `amount` variable. Otherwise, the `else` clause says we'll just politely respond with `"No, thanks."` and leave `amount` unchanged.

As we discussed in "Values & Types" earlier, values that aren't already of an expected type are often coerced to that type. The `if` statement expects a `boolean`, but if you pass it something that's not already `boolean`, coercion will occur.

JavaScript defines a list of specific values that are considered "falsy" because when coerced to a `boolean`, they become `false` -- these include values like `0` and `""`. Any other value not on the "falsy" list is automatically "truthy" -- when coerced to a `boolean` they become `true`. Truthy values include things like `99.99` and `"free"`. See "Truthy & Falsy" in Chapter 2 for more information.

*Conditionals* exist in other forms besides the `if`. For example, the `switch` statement can be used as a shorthand for a series of `if..else` statements (see Chapter 2). Loops (see "Loops") use a *conditional* to determine if the loop should keep going or stop.

**Note:** For deeper information about the coercions that can occur implicitly in the test expressions of *conditionals*, see Chapter 4 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.

## 循环

在高峰时段，有很多排队等候与电话商店员工通话的顾客，虽然排队的人很多，但是她每次只需要服务好当前客户。
During busy times, there's a waiting list for customers who need to speak to the phone store employee. While there's still people on that list, she just needs to keep serving the next customer.

程序中的循环是指重复一组动作，直到某个条件失败的时候停止，换句话说，程序中的循环只有在条件成立时才会重复执行；循环可以采用不同的形式，但是他们必须满足这个基本行为。
Repeating a set of actions until a certain condition fails -- in other words, repeating only while the condition holds -- is the job of programming loops; loops can take different forms, but they all satisfy this basic behavior.

循环包括判断条件和循环体（通常为`{ .. }`）。每次条件成立时执行循环体，这就是常说的*迭代*。
A loop includes the test condition as well as a block (typically as `{ .. }`). Each time the loop block executes, that's called an *iteration*.

比如，`while`循环和`do..while`循环体现了循环体会在条件不再等于`true`时停止执行。
For example, the `while` loop and the `do..while` loop forms illustrate the concept of repeating a block of statements until a condition no longer evaluates to `true`:

```js
while (numOfCustomers > 0) {
	console.log( "How may I help you?" );

	// help the customer...

	numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1;
}

// versus:

do {
	console.log( "How may I help you?" );

	// help the customer...

	numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1;
} while (numOfCustomers > 0);
```

这2种循环唯一的区别是在第一次迭代之前（`while`）还是之后(`do..while`)进行条件判定。
The only practical difference between these loops is whether the conditional is tested before the first iteration (`while`) or after the first iteration (`do..while`).

在任一形式中，如果条件判定为`false`，下一次迭代将不再执行。这意味着如果初始判定条件为`false`，那么`while`循环将永远不会执行，但是`do..while`循环仅会执行第一次迭代。
In either form, if the conditional tests as `false`, the next iteration will not run. That means if the condition is initially `false`, a `while` loop will never run, but a `do..while` loop will run just the first time.

有时候你想要循环计算类似`0`到`9`这样的一组数字，你可以设置一个循环变量`i`，这个变量初始值为`0`,在每次迭代后自身加`1`。
Sometimes you are looping for the intended purpose of counting a certain set of numbers, like from `0` to `9` (ten numbers). You can do that by setting a loop iteration variable like `i` at value `0` and incrementing it by `1` each iteration.

**警告：** 以为一些历史原因，编程语言总是以`0`作为基准数字的形式计数，即以`0`为开始而不是`1`。如果你不熟悉这种思维模式，在初学阶段可能会感到很困惑，多花一些时间来练习从`0`开始计数，将使你在学习编程语言的时候变得更加从容。
**Warning:** For a variety of historical reasons, programming languages almost always count things in a zero-based fashion, meaning starting with `0` instead of `1`. If you're not familiar with that mode of thinking, it can be quite confusing at first. Take some time to practice counting starting with `0` to become more comfortable with it!

每次迭代的时候都会去测试判断条件是否成立，就好像在循环体中有一个隐含的`if`语句。
The conditional is tested on each iteration, much as if there is an implied `if` statement inside the loop.

我们可以通过JavaScript中的`break`语句来停止一次循环，此外，我们可以看到，没有断点机制非常容易出现死循环。
We can use JavaScript's `break` statement to stop a loop. Also, we can observe that it's awfully easy to create a loop that would otherwise run forever without a `break`ing mechanism.

让我们来说明一下：
Let's illustrate:

```js
var i = 0;

// a `while..true` loop would run forever, right?
while (true) {
	// stop the loop?
	if ((i <= 9) === false) {
		break;
	}

	console.log( i );
	i = i + 1;
}
// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

**警告：** 这并不是一个好的实现循环的形式，这里仅仅为了说明上面的观点。
**Warning:** This is not necessarily a practical form you'd want to use for your loops. It's presented here for illustration purposes only.

虽然`while`（或`do..while`）可以实现上述要求，但还有另一个被称作`for`循环的形式可以达到项目的目的。
While a `while` (or `do..while`) can accomplish the task manually, there's another syntactic form called a `for` loop for just that purpose:

```js
for (var i = 0; i <= 9; i = i + 1) {
	console.log( i );
}
// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

正如你所见，在这两种循环形式下，前10次循环（`i`从`0`到`9`）中，`i <= 9`的结果是`true`，但是当`i`的值是`10`时，`i <= 9`的结果是`false`。
As you can see, in both cases the conditional `i <= 9` is `true` for the first 10 iterations (`i` of values `0` through `9`) of either loop form, but becomes `false` once `i` is value `10`.

`for`循环有3条子语句：初始化语句(`var i=0`)，条件判断语句(`i <= 9`)，更新循环变量语句(`i = i + 1`)。所以
The `for` loop has three clauses: the initialization clause (`var i=0`), the conditional test clause (`i <= 9`), and the update clause (`i = i + 1`). So if you're going to do counting with your loop iterations, `for` is a more compact and often easier form to understand and write.

还有其他用来迭代特定值的循环形式，比如迭代对象的属性（见第二章），其中隐含的判断条件只是所有的属性是否都被处理。无论什么形式的循环，“直到条件失败才结束循环”的基本行为始终保持。
There are other specialized loop forms that are intended to iterate over specific values, such as the properties of an object (see Chapter 2) where the implied conditional test is just whether all the properties have been processed. The "loop until a condition fails" concept holds no matter what the form of the loop.

## 函数
## Functions

电话商店员工可能不会随身携带计算器来计算税金和最终购买金额。这是她需要定义一次并且重复使用的任务。奇怪的是，公司有一个内置这些功能的结账机器（电脑，平板电脑等）。
The phone store employee probably doesn't carry around a calculator to figure out the taxes and final purchase amount. That's a task she needs to define once and reuse over and over again. Odds are, the company has a checkout register (computer, tablet, etc.) with those "functions" built in.

同样的，你的程序肯定想要将代码的任务分解成可重用的部分，而不是重复的重复自己（双关意图）。定义一个`function`可以实现这个目的。
Similarly, your program will almost certainly want to break up the code's tasks into reusable pieces, instead of repeatedly repeating yourself repetitiously (pun intended!). The way to do this is to define a `function`.

函数通常是一个可以通过定义时命名的名称调用的代码段，其中的代码将在每次被调用时执行。考虑下面的代码：
A function is generally a named section of code that can be "called" by name, and the code inside it will be run each time. Consider:

```js
function printAmount() {
	console.log( amount.toFixed( 2 ) );
}

var amount = 99.99;

printAmount(); // "99.99"

amount = amount * 2;

printAmount(); // "199.98"
```

函数可以选择接受参数（aka参数）-- 你传递的值。同时也可以选择返回一个值。
Functions can optionally take arguments (aka parameters) -- values you pass in. And they can also optionally return a value back.

```js
function printAmount(amt) {
	console.log( amt.toFixed( 2 ) );
}

function formatAmount() {
	return "$" + amount.toFixed( 2 );
}

var amount = 99.99;

printAmount( amount * 2 );		// "199.98"

amount = formatAmount();
console.log( amount );			// "$99.99"
```

`printAmount(..)`函数接受一个被称作`amt`的参数，`formatAmount()`函数返回一个值。当然，你可以在同一个函数里组合这2个方法。
The function `printAmount(..)` takes a parameter that we call `amt`. The function `formatAmount()` returns a value. Of course, you can also combine those two techniques in the same function.

函数常常被用来封装想要多次调用的代码，但他们也可用于将相关联的代码部分封装在一个被命名的集合中，即使你只打算调用一次。
Functions are often used for code that you plan to call multiple times, but they can also be useful just to organize related bits of code into named collections, even if you only plan to call them once.

考虑下面的代码：
Consider:

```js
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;

function calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(amt) {
	// calculate the new amount with the tax
	amt = amt + (amt * TAX_RATE);

	// return the new amount
	return amt;
}

var amount = 99.99;

amount = calculateFinalPurchaseAmount( amount );

console.log( amount.toFixed( 2 ) );		// "107.99"
```

虽然`calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(..)`只被调用了一次，但是通过将他的逻辑（`amount = calculateFinal...`语句）封装成一个单独的命名函数，使得代码更容易被阅读。如果函数中包含更多的语句，其好处将更加明显。
Although `calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(..)` is only called once, organizing its behavior into a separate named function makes the code that uses its logic (the `amount = calculateFinal...` statement) cleaner. If the function had more statements in it, the benefits would be even more pronounced.

## 作用域
### Scope

如果你想购买一款手机专卖店里没有的型号的手机，她是无法卖给你的，她只能在商店所提供的手机型号中售卖。如果你想购买你所需的手机型号，那你必须去别的商店里找找了。
If you ask the phone store employee for a phone model that her store doesn't carry, she will not be able to sell you the phone you want. She only has access to the phones in her store's inventory. You'll have to try another store to see if you can find the phone you're looking for.

编程中对这个概念有一个术语：*作用域*（技术上称为词法作用域）。在JavaScript中，每个函数拥有自己的独立作用域。作用域是一个包含如何按变量名称访问规则的变量集合。只有在该函数内部的代码可以访问该函数限定的变量作用域
Programming has a term for this concept: *scope* (technically called *lexical scope*). In JavaScript, each function gets its own scope. Scope is basically a collection of variables as well as the rules for how those variables are accessed by name. Only code inside that function can access that function's *scoped* variables.

一个变量名称在同一个作用域内必须是唯一的 -- 不能有2个不同的`a`变量在同一作用域内，但是同样的变量名称`a`可以出现在不同作用域内。
A variable name has to be unique within the same scope -- there can't be two different `a` variables sitting right next to each other. But the same variable name `a` could appear in different scopes.

```js
function one() {
	// this `a` only belongs to the `one()` function
	var a = 1;
	console.log( a );
}

function two() {
	// this `a` only belongs to the `two()` function
	var a = 2;
	console.log( a );
}

one();		// 1
two();		// 2
```

另外，一个作用域可以嵌套在另一个作用域内，就想生日聚会上的小丑吹一个套在另一个气球里的气球一样。如果一个作用域嵌套在另一个作用域内，则最内层作用域的代码可以访问任一作用域内的变量。
Also, a scope can be nested inside another scope, just like if a clown at a birthday party blows up one balloon inside another balloon. If one scope is nested inside another, code inside the innermost scope can access variables from either scope.

考虑下面的代码：
Consider:

```js
function outer() {
	var a = 1;

	function inner() {
		var b = 2;

		// we can access both `a` and `b` here
		console.log( a + b );	// 3
	}

	inner();

	// we can only access `a` here
	console.log( a );			// 1
}

outer();
```

词法作用域规则定义，一个作用域中的变量可以访问该作用域范围或其外部作用域范围的任意变量。
Lexical scope rules say that code in one scope can access variables of either that scope or any scope outside of it.

所以，`inner()`函数中的代码可以同时访问变量`a`和变量`b`，但是`outer()`函数只能访问变量`a`，不能访问变量`b`的原因是变量`b`只存在于`inner()`函数的作用域中。
So, code inside the `inner()` function has access to both variables `a` and `b`, but code in `outer()` has access only to `a` -- it cannot access `b` because that variable is only inside `inner()`.

回想之前的代码片段：
Recall this code snippet from earlier:

```js
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;

function calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(amt) {
	// calculate the new amount with the tax
	amt = amt + (amt * TAX_RATE);

	// return the new amount
	return amt;
}
```

因为词法作用域。我们可以在`calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(..)`函数内部访问`TAX_RATE`常量(变量)，即使我们并没有把它当做参数传递进去。
The `TAX_RATE` constant (variable) is accessible from inside the `calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(..)` function, even though we didn't pass it in, because of lexical scope.

**注意：**有关更多词法作用域的信息，请参阅本系列*作用域和闭包*的前三个章节
**Note:** For more information about lexical scope, see the first three chapters of the *Scope & Closures* title of this series.

## 练习
## Practice

在学习编程的过程中，实践是不可或缺的。在你变成一个程序员的过程中
There is absolutely no substitute for practice in learning programming. No amount of articulate writing on my part is alone going to make you a programmer.

考虑到这一点，让我们尝试练习本章中所学到的一些概念。我会给出“需求”，你先独自尝试。然后可以参考下面的代码列表看看我是如何实现它的。
With that in mind, let's try practicing some of the concepts we learned here in this chapter. I'll give the "requirements," and you try it first. Then consult the code listing below to see how I approached it.

* 编写一个程序用来计算你购买手机的总价。你会不断购买手机（提示：循环！）直到你花光你银行账户里的所有资金。只要你的购买金额低于你的精神消费阈值，你还会为每一个手机购买相应的配件。
* Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of money in your bank account. You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.

* 在计算完你的购买金额后，加入纳税金额，然后打印出格式正确的经过计算的购买金额
* After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.

* 最终，检查你的银行账户余额，看是否负担得起。
* Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.

* 你应当为“税率”，“手机单价”，“配件单价”和“支出上限”设置一些常量，并为你的“银行账户余额”设置一个变量。
* You should set up some constants for the "tax rate," "phone price," "accessory price," and "spending threshold," as well as a variable for your "bank account balance.""

* 你应当定义一个用来计算税金和把价格变为四舍五入保留两位小数并且带“$”前缀格式的函数
* You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a "$" and rounding to two decimal places.
* **奖励挑战：**尝试将输入合并到此程序中，或许在输入前还可以增加“提示”功能。例如，你可以提示用户的银行账户余额。让它变的更有创造性和趣味
* **Bonus Challenge:** Try to incorporate input into this program, perhaps with the `prompt(..)` covered in "Input" earlier. You may prompt the user for their bank account balance, for example. Have fun and be creative!

好的，继续尝试完成它。在你完成自己的程序前不要偷看我的代码。
OK, go ahead. Try it. Don't peek at my code listing until you've given it a shot yourself!

**注意：** 因为这是一本关于JavaScript的书，很明显我会用JavaScript语言去完成练习。但是你可以用任一一种你熟悉的编程语言来实现它。
**Note:** Because this is a JavaScript book, I'm obviously going to solve the practice exercise in JavaScript. But you can do it in another language for now if you feel more comfortable.

这是我解决这个练习的JavaScript方案
Here's my JavaScript solution for this exercise:

```js
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;

function calculateTax(amount) {
	return amount * TAX_RATE;
}

function formatAmount(amount) {
	return "$" + amount.toFixed( 2 );
}

// keep buying phones while you still have money
while (amount < bank_balance) {
	// buy a new phone!
	amount = amount + PHONE_PRICE;

	// can we afford the accessory?
	if (amount < SPENDING_THRESHOLD) {
		amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
	}
}

// don't forget to pay the government, too
amount = amount + calculateTax( amount );

console.log(
	"Your purchase: " + formatAmount( amount )
);
// Your purchase: $334.76

// can you actually afford this purchase?
if (amount > bank_balance) {
	console.log(
		"You can't afford this purchase. :("
	);
}
// You can't afford this purchase. :(
```

**注意：** 运行此JavaScript程序最简单的方法是将其输入到你默认浏览器的控制台中。
**Note:** The simplest way to run this JavaScript program is to type it into the developer console of your nearest browser.

你怎么实现的？阅读到这里，你已经看到我的实现代码。你可以再次尝试，并通过改变一些常量来观察程序运行后再不同的值下的运行结果。
How did you do? It wouldn't hurt to try it again now that you've seen my code. And play around with changing some of the constants to see how the program runs with different values.

## 复习
## Review

学习编程并不是一个复杂和压制性的过程。你仅仅需要把一些基本概念武装在你的脑海里。
Learning programming doesn't have to be a complex and overwhelming process. There are just a few basic concepts you need to wrap your head around.

这些行为就像搭建积木。 如果你想要搭建一座高塔，那你需要不断往上垒砖块。编程也一样。这里有一些用来编程的基本模块
These act like building blocks. To build a tall tower, you start first by putting block on top of block on top of block. The same goes with programming. Here are some of the essential programming building blocks:

* 你需要*运算符*来对值进行操作
* You need *operators* to perform actions on values.

* 你需要值和*类型*来执行不同类型的操作，比如用`number`类型做数学运算，用`string`类型输出。
* You need values and *types* to perform different kinds of actions like math on `number`s or output with `string`s.
* 在程序执行期间，你需要*变量*来存储数据（aka *状态*）
* You need *variables* to store data (aka *state*) during your program's execution.

* 在`if`语句中，你需要根据*条件*来决定做什么。
* You need *conditionals* like `if` statements to make decisions.*

* 你需要*循环*来重复执行任务，直到停止条件变为true。
* You need *loops* to repeat tasks until a condition stops being true.* *

* 你需要通过*函数*来把你的代码和逻辑组织在一起形成一个可重用的代码块。
* You need *functions* to organize your code into logical and reusable chunks.* * *

代码注释是编写更容易阅读的代码的有效方式，它可以使得你的程序在遇到问题时变得更容易理解，维护和修复。
Code comments are one effective way to write more readable code, which makes your program easier to understand, maintain, and fix later if there are problems.

最终，不要忽视时间的力量。学习如何编写代码的最好方式就是不断写代码。
Finally, don't neglect the power of practice. The best way to learn how to write code is to write code.

我很高兴你现在正在学习如何编写代码！继续努力吧，不要忘记查阅其他初学者编程资源（书，博客，在线教程等）。这章和这本书是一个很好的开始，但他们只是一个简单的介绍。
I'm excited you're well on your way to learning how to code, now! Keep it up. Don't forget to check out other beginner programming resources (books, blogs, online training, etc.). This chapter and this book are a great start, but they're just a brief introduction.

下一张会从更具体的JavaScript视角回顾本章提到的许多概念，将突出本系列其余部分中更深入的主题。
The next chapter will review many of the concepts from this chapter, but from a more JavaScript-specific perspective, which will highlight most of the major topics that are addressed in deeper detail throughout the rest of the series.
